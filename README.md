# Text Classification to understand which students may need to work on their motor skills at a young age by image analysis of handwriting
# Scope : 
  - Use Machine Learning models to analyse handwriting and accurately predict the english alphabet they have written if the student may need to work on their motor skills.
# Tasks : 
  - Built a KNN model with the optimal value of K to predict handwriting correctly 
  - Built a Random Forest model with the optimal number of trees to predict handwriting. 
  - Built a Neural Network model with the optimal number of neurons and perceptrons to predict handwriting. 
  - Compared all the models with benchmark metrics and recommended the right model to use.
# Technology Stack : 
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - K-Nearest Neighbour
  - Recursive Feature Elimination
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network
# Role :
  - Data Analyst
